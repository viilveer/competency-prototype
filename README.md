REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 7.1.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar install --prefer-dist
~~~

Before you can access the application properly .htaccess file must be also added to `web/` folder. You can use the example file for that. Following command creates a copy of example `.htaccess.dist` in `web/` folder

~~~
cp web/.htaccess.dist web/.htaccess
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application but before using it the following configuration steps should be taken.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Make a copy from `config/db.php.dist` and name it `config/db.php`

~~~
cp config/db.php.dist config/db.php
~~~

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
- Refer to the README in the `tests` directory for information specific to basic application tests.

DATA MIGRATION
-------

To create needed tables for the application following command must be executed.

~~~
./yii migrate
~~~

This command executes all SQL statements in order to build up the database schema.

TESTING
-------

Tests are located in `tests` directory. They are developed with [Codeception PHP Testing Framework](http://codeception.com/).
By default there are 3 test suites:

- `unit`
- `functional`
- `acceptance`

Tests can be executed by running

```
vendor/bin/codecept run
```

The command above will execute unit and functional tests. Unit tests are testing the system components, while functional
tests are for testing user interaction. Acceptance tests are disabled by default as they require additional setup since
they perform testing in real browser.
